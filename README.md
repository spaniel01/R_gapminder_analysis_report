### Description and purpose
Using the gapminder dataset, made available through the gapminder R package, available [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/gapminder/versions/0.3.0) and drawn from World Bank data, an explanatory data analysis is conducted (including multiple regression) and various plots (scatter, col, mean and error bar etc.) are generated. The findings are interpreted. 

The purpose of the analysis was to answer to questions: 

1. Which continents and countries are in greatest need of humanitarian aid?
2. Can a more sophisticated method for selecting recipient countries, other than simply providing aid to the countries with lowest life expectancy, be developed from the dataset?

Please note that the focus was not on regression, so that model assumptions were not checked. See forthcoming projects.
